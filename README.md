# NumberQuest
The "NumberQuest" game is implemented using JavaScript. It generates a random number for players to guess. The game provides feedback, updates the score, tracks the highest score, and allows replay. JavaScript handles events, manipulates the DOM, and modifies CSS for interactivity and visual appeal.
